# IBM-Project-27678-1660062691
Fertilizers Recommendation System For Disease Prediction
## Project Objectives

Preprocess the images.

Applying the CNN algorithm to the dataset.

How deep neural networks detect the disease.

You will be able to know how to find the accuracy of the model.

You will be able to build web applications using the Flask framework.

## Project Flow

### A web Application is built  where: 

Farmers can interact with the portal build

Interacts with the user interface to upload images of diseased leaf

Our model built analyses the Disease and suggests the farmer with fertilizers are to be used 

### To accomplish the above task you must complete the below activities and tasks: 

Download the dataset.

Classify the dataset into train and test sets.

Add the neural network layers.

Load the trained images and fit the model. 

Test the model.

Save the model and its dependencies.

Build a Web application using a flask that integrates with the model built.
