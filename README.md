# IBM-Project-27678-1660062691
Fertilizers Recommendation System For Disease Prediction
## Project Objectives

Preprocess the images.

Applying the CNN algorithm to the dataset.

How deep neural networks detect the disease.

You will be able to know how to find the accuracy of the model.

You will be able to build web applications using the Flask framework.

## Project Flow

### A web Application is built  where: 

Farmers can interact with the portal build

Interacts with the user interface to upload images of diseased leaf

Our model built analyses the Disease and suggests the farmer with fertilizers are to be used 

### To accomplish the above task you must complete the below activities and tasks: 

Download the dataset.

Classify the dataset into train and test sets.

Add the neural network layers.

Load the trained images and fit the model. 

Test the model.

Save the model and its dependencies.

Build a Web application using a flask that integrates with the model built.


## Project Structure

The dataset folder contains two folders for the fruit and vegetable dataset which again contains a test and train folder, each of them have images of different diseases.

The Flask folder has all the files necessary to build the flask application. 

The static folder has the images, style sheets, and scripts that are needed in building the web page.

Templates folder has the HTML pages.

Uploads folder has the uploads made by the user

app.py is the python script for server-side computing.

.h5 files are the model files that are to be saved after model building.

Precautions excel files contain the precautions for all kinds of diseases.

Fruit-Training.ipynb, Vegetable-Training, and Plant-Disease-Testing.ipynb are the training and testing notebooks.

IBM folder contains IBM deployment files.


## Data Collection

### The first step is to download the dataset 

Create Train and Test folders with each folder having subfolders with leaf images of different plant diseases. You can collect datasets from different open sources like kaggle.com, data.gov, UCI machine learning repository, etc. The folder contains the provided in the project structure section has the link from where you can download datasets that can be used for training. Two datasets will be used, we will be creating two models one to detect vegetable leaf diseases like tomato, potato, and pepper plants and the second model would be for fruits diseases like corn, peach, and apple.
